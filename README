NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Inline - Create test files for inline tests
    in POD sections

VERSION
    version 0.0100000

DESCRIPTION
    The code of this Dist::Zilla file gatherer plugin is mainly taken from
    <https://github.com/moose/moose/blob/master/inc/ExtractInlineTests.pm>.

    This plugin integrates Test::Inline into "Dist::Zilla". It scans all
    modules for inline tests in POD sections that are embedded between the
    keywords

            =begin testing
            ...
            =end testing

    and exports them into .t files when building your module. Multiple of
    these test sections may be specified within one file.

    For more details about the great idea of inline tests see Test::Inline.

    Please note that this plugin can also handle Moops-like class and role
    definitions.

    Example: # My/AddressRange.pm

            =begin testing

            use Test::Exception;

            dies_ok {
                    My::AddressRange->list_from_range('10.2.3.A', '10.2.3.5')
            } "list_from_range() complains about invalid address";

            =end testing

            sub list_from_range {
                    # ...
            }

NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::Inline - Create test files for inline tests
    in POD sections

VERSION
    version 0.011000

SYNOPSIS
    In your "dist.ini":

            [Test::Inline]

    In your module:

            # My/AddressRange.pm

            =begin testing

            use Test::Exception;
            dies_ok {
                    My::AddressRange->list_from_range('10.2.3.A', '10.2.3.5')
            } "list_from_range() complains about invalid address";

            =end testing

            sub list_from_range {
                    # ...
            }

    This will result in a file "t/inline-tests/my_addressrange.t" in your
    distribution.

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin integrates Test::Inline into "Dist::Zilla".

    It scans all modules for inline tests in POD sections that are embedded
    between the keywords

            =begin testing
            ...
            =end testing

    and exports them into "t/inline-tests/*.t" files when "Dist::Zilla"
    builds your module. Multiple of these test sections may be specified
    within one file.

    Please note that this plugin (in contrast to pure Test::Inline) can also
    handle Moops-like class and role definitions.

EXTENDS
    *   Moose::Object

METHODS
  gather_files
    Required by role Dist::Zilla::Role::FileGatherer.

    Searches for inline test code in POD sections using Test::Inline,
    creates in-memory test files and passes them to Dist::Zilla.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    The code of this Dist::Zilla file gatherer plugin is mainly taken from
    <https://github.com/moose/moose/blob/master/inc/ExtractInlineTests.pm>.

    *   Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>, who basically wrote all this but
        left the honor of making a plugin of it to me ;-)
